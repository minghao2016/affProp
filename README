- R implementation of the affinity propagation code from

B.J. Frey and D. Dueck (2007) Clustering by Passing Messages Between Data Points. Science 315, 972

- just a line by line translation of the original matlab code
- needs refactoring
- meanwhile there seems to be an R-package at CRAN called apcluster
  and also a publication in Bioinformatics:
  
U Bodenhofer, A Kothmeier, and S Hochreiter (2011) APCluster: an R package for affinity propagation clustering. Bioinformatics 27:2463-2464
